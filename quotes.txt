All Work no play makes jack a dull boy.
It’s not fully shipped until it’s fast.
Anything added dilutes everything else.
Practicality beats purity.
Approachable is better than simple.
Mind your words, they are important.
Half measures are as bad as nothing at all.
Encourage flow.
Non-blocking is better than blocking.
Avoid administrative distraction.
Anger is your first enemy.
Be home be safe.
Be calm to be awesome.
Be confident so you can be happy.
You will be victorus if you believe in yourself.
